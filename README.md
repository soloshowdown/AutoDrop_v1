# AutoDrop--v1
_Automatically turn meeting discussions into actionable tasks on a Kanban board._

## 📌 Project Overview
AutoDrop is a major project aimed at simplifying task management from meetings.  
The platform will:
- Capture **live or recorded meeting audio/video**.
- Generate a **transcript** using speech-to-text (Whisper).
- Extract **action items, deadlines, and key points** using NLP/LLMs.
- Auto-populate tasks into a **dynamic Kanban board** (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done).
- Allow users to **edit, drag-drop, and export tasks**.

This project demonstrates the integration of **AI (speech + NLP)** with **web development** for intelligent productivity tools.

## 🏗️ Planned Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js + Tailwind CSS (Kanban UI, upload interface)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js/Express (API + processing)  
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL (meetings, transcripts, tasks)  
- **AI Models:**
  - Whisper (speech-to-text)  
  - LLM API (GPT, Gemini, or open-source LLaMA) for action-item extraction  
- **Optional:** Pyannote for speaker diarization
