🏗️ System Architecture for All-in-One Auto Scrum Platform
🔹 1. Video Meeting Module

Built-in video conferencing (instead of Zoom/Meet).

Features:

Live transcription.

Speaker diarization (who is speaking).

Meeting recording + playback.

Tech stack:

WebRTC → core for real-time video/audio.

Mediasoup / Janus / Jitsi SDK → scalable SFU (selective forwarding unit).

OpenAI Whisper / Vosk → real-time speech-to-text.

FastAPI / Node.js → signaling server.

🔹 2. Real-Time Transcription & NLP Engine

Converts conversation into structured Scrum artifacts:

Tasks (“Riya will test login API”).

Blockers (“We’re waiting on API docs”).

Decisions (“We’ll use Mongo instead of Postgres”).

Tech stack:

Whisper (speech → text).

Hugging Face Transformers (NER, summarization) → extract tasks, deadlines, assignees.

spaCy → entity recognition (names, dates, actions).

LangChain → chaining prompts/models if using LLMs.

🔹 3. Kanban Board (Native, not Trello)

Integrated task board with drag-and-drop.

Auto-populated from meeting insights.

Features:

Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done.

Task cards with assignee, deadline, priority.

Sprint grouping.

Tech stack:

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + DnD library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd).

Backend: FastAPI/Node + PostgreSQL (task management).

WebSockets (Socket.IO) → real-time updates across users.

🔹 4. Sprint Planning & Automation

Auto-create sprint backlog from tasks.

Effort estimation with ML.

Auto-assign tasks based on:

Member workload.

Historical velocity.

Skillset.

Tech stack:

ML Models (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow).

Historical sprint data → training for story point prediction.

Optimization algorithm for fair workload distribution.

🔹 5. Project Monitoring & Analytics

Real-time dashboards:

Sprint velocity.

Burndown charts.

Blocker tracking.

Team participation heatmap (who speaks, who doesn’t).

Tech stack:

Recharts / D3.js for graphs.

Postgres/MongoDB for historical data.

Celery + Redis for background analytics jobs.

🔹 6. Collaboration Features

Chat + file sharing inside platform.

Meeting notes auto-summarized.

Notifications:

In-app.

Email/Slack integration.

Tech stack:

Socket.IO → real-time chat.

MinIO / Firebase Storage / S3 → file storage.

NLP summarization → meeting notes.

🔹 7. Authentication & Security

User roles: Scrum Master, Developer, Manager.

SSO (Google/Microsoft login).

Role-based permissions (only Scrum Master can close sprints).

Tech stack:

JWT tokens.

OAuth2 (Google, Microsoft).

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

🔹 8. Deployment & Scalability

Docker + Kubernetes for containerized microservices.

Load balancing for meetings (SFU scaling).

Cloud: AWS (EKS, S3, RDS) or GCP (GKE, Cloud Storage, BigQuery).

CDN for fast frontend delivery.

🔮 User Flow

Start Meeting in Platform → video + live transcript.

AI Engine extracts tasks/blockers → Kanban auto-updates.

Sprint board is auto-generated → tasks assigned to devs.

During sprint → burndown chart & velocity updated in real time.

Post-sprint → platform auto-generates retro summary + next sprint suggestions.

📈 Development Roadmap
✅ Phase 1 (MVP – 6-8 weeks)

Video meetings (WebRTC + transcription).

NLP → extract tasks & show on dashboard.

Basic Kanban board (manual + auto task creation).

✅ Phase 2 (2-3 months)

Sprint planning automation.

Real-time Kanban updates across users.

Analytics (burndown, velocity).

Notifications (email/slack).

✅ Phase 3 (4-6 months)

Smart workload balancing.

Predictive analytics (sprint delay forecast).

Engagement tracking (meeting participation heatmap).

Chat + file sharing.

✅ Phase 4 (Enterprise-ready)

Multi-project support.

Role-based permissions.

Cloud deployment (scalable SFU + AI microservices).

Mobile app (React Native).
